// TransactionPrepareRequest is used to prepare a set of JSON formatted developer friendly
// inputs, into a raw transaction ready for submission to the blockchain.
//
// The connector is responsible for encoding the transaction ready for submission,
// and returning the hash for the transaction as well as a string serialization of
// the pre-signed raw transaction in a format of its own choosing (hex etc.).
// The hash is expected to be a function of:
// - the method signature
// - the signing identity
// - the nonce
// - the particular blockchain the transaction is submitted to
// - the input parameters
//
// If "gas" is not supplied, the connector is expected to perform gas estimation
// prior to generating the payload.
//
// See the list of standard error reasons that should be returned for situations that can be
// detected by the back-end connector.
